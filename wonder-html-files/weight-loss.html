                <h1 id="tips-title" >Drink Plenty Of Water</h1>
                <p>It is often claimed that drinking water can help with weight loss — and that’s true.

                    Drinking water can boost metabolism by 24–30% over a period of 1–1.5 hours, helping you
                    burn off a few more
                    calories (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source).

                    One study showed that drinking a half-liter (17 ounces) of water about half an hour
                    before meals helped dieters
                    eat fewer calories and lose 44% more weight, compared to those who didn’t drink the
                    water.</p>

                <h1 id="tips-title" >Drink Black Coffee Everyday</h1>
                <p>Coffee has been unfairly demonized. Quality coffee is loaded with antioxidants and can
                    have numerous health
                    benefits.

                    Studies show that the caffeine in coffee can boost metabolism by 3–11% and increase fat
                    burning by up to 10–29%.

                    Just make sure not to add a bunch of sugar or other high-calorie ingredients to your
                    coffee. That will
                    completely negate any benefits.

                <h1 id="tips-title" > Don’t Drink Sugary Drinks, Including COKE & Beer </h1>
                <p>Sugar is bad, but sugar in liquid form is even worse. Studies show that calories from
                    liquid sugar may be the
                    single most fattening aspect of the modern diet.

                    For example, one study showed that sugar-sweetened beverages are linked to a 60%
                    increased risk of obesity in
                    children for each daily serving.

                    Keep in mind that this applies to fruit juice as well, which contains a similar amount
                    of sugar as a soft drink
                    like Coke.

                    Eat whole fruit, but limit or avoid fruit juice altogether.

                <h1 id="tips-title" >Avoid apocessed and refined products</h1>
                <p>Processed foods contain trans fat that can lead to weight gain. So, all kinds of
                    processed foods must be
                    avoided when trying to shed kilos. Even all kinds of refined products like refined
                    sugar, refined flour and
                    refined oil must be avoided. Focus on eating whole-grain, green veggies, fruits. They
                    are healthy and
                    nutritious. The nutrients can aid in your weight loss and can increase your metabolism
                    to shed more kilos.

                <h1 id="tips-title" >Sleep on time</h1>
                <p>Yes, your sleeping pattern can also sabotage your weight loss goal. Sleeplessness or
                    irregular sleeping
                    patterns can make you feel hungry and irritated in the morning. You will eventually end
                    up eating more in the
                    morning. To avoid this, try to get 7-8 hours of sleep every night. Adjusting your
                    sleeping pattern can improve
                    your overall health and reduce stress level. Studies show that poor sleep can lead to
                    obesity. It can increase
                    the risk of obesity by 89 per cent in children and 55 per cent in adults.

                <h1 id="tips-title" >Do not skip your breakfast</h1>
                <p>Skipping the meal, especially breakfast is quite common among people trying to shed
                    kilos. It is based on a
                    misconception that skipping breakfast is a great way to cut calories. In reality, it
                    makes a person eat more
                    later in the day. Studies show people who eat breakfast have lower BMIs than the ones
                    who often skip their first
                    meal. The ideal way is to divide the daily calories into three equal parts and have
                    foods accordingly. Skipping
                    meals or starving yourself slow down the metabolism and can halt your progress.

                <h1 id="tips-title" >Daily do exercise & yoga </h1>
                <p>When it comes to weight loss, dieting is certainly more important than exercising. It is
                    actually 80 per cent
                    diet and 20 per cent exercising. But without exercising sustainable weight loss is not
                    possible. Staying
                    physically active helps to burn more calories, tone your body and build more muscles.
                    Whether you choose to do
                    running, gymming, yoga, swimming or cycling, it does not matter. Just make sure you stay
                    physically active.</p>
