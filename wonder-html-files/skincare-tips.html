                <p>Rice water is rich in amino acids, antioxidants and minerals which may reduce or slow down the skin
                    ageing
                    process. It could also inhibit the activity of elastase, an enzyme responsible for skin ageing.
                    Thus, rice water
                    could help maintain skin elasticity and can reduce the appearance of ageing signs on the skin.
                    It can brighten your skin
                    One of the key functions of rice water is to brighten the skin and provide an even skin tone. It
                    keeps your skin
                    healthy, glowing and clear.The outermost layer of skin is known as a skin barrier that prevents your
                    skin from
                    becoming dried up and vulnerable to conditions like eczema and atopic dermatitis. However, using
                    rice water on
                    the face enables its starch content to protect the skin barrier naturally.

                <p>What stress does to your face?
                    <br>
                    When you feel stressed, your sympathetic nervous system releases stress hormones like cortisol and
                    adrenaline
                    into your body. Cortisol causes increased oil production in your skin glands, which can lead to
                    clogged pores
                    and acne breakouts.Although it’s widely believed that stress causes acne, there are only a few
                    studies that have
                    examined the connection.
                    A 2017 studyTrusted Source looked at the effect of stress on acne in female medical students between
                    the ages of
                    22 to 24. The researchers found that higher levels of stress positively correlated with acne
                    severity.

                <h2></h2>
                <p>There’s no need to wash the face more than twice a day. In fact, doing so may dry out your skin.
                    When this happens, Ivonne says skin “does whatever it needs to do to regain moisture.”
                    This includes “making its sebum production work in overdrive, causing more oil and more acne than
                    there was
                    originally.”
                    If you fall into this category, opt for a cleanser containing hydroxy acids to remove excess oil.
                    Medicated cleansers are also worth your attention.
                    Bags under the eyes are characterized by swelling or puffiness beneath your eyelids. They become
                    more common
                    with age since the supporting muscles around your eyes weaken. Sagging skin caused by a loss of
                    elasticity can
                    also contribute to eye bags.

                <p>Hyaluronic Acid sounds much scarier than it is and many of us wouldn't dream of putting acid on our
                    faces,
                    however, Hyaluronic Acid is actually a gel-like substance that has the unique ability to retain
                    moisture. In
                    fact, our bodies produce it naturally to help us retain moisture in our skin. It is also found in
                    our eyes,
                    joints, and connective tissue. We produce less and less Hyaluronic Acid as we age and our skin
                    becomes dryer and
                    less elastic as a result, which causes us to develop deep-set wrinkles. This is why it works
                    wonderfully as an
                    anti-aging component in face creams and serums, as the Hyaluronic Acid can hold over 1,000 times
                    it's weight in
                    water. </p>

                <p>When it comes to your beauty routine, sleep may be the closest thing there is to a fountain of youth.
                    Your body
                    repairs itself and recovers while you snooze, and that leads to a long list of benefits for your
                    looks. The key
                    is to get enough shut-eye -- 7 to 9 quality hours each night.
                    If you’re getting fewer than 6 hours, it’s likely affecting your appearance, says Michael Breus,
                    PhD, a
                    board-certified sleep specialist. Start getting 1 to 3 more hours of Zzz's, and you could see some
                    improvement
                    in as little as a day. Keep it up, and “within 2 to 3 weeks, people will notice that you’re sleeping
                    better by
                    the way you look,” Breus says.

                <h1  id="tips-title"> Exfoliate a couple times per week</h1>
                <p>Exfoliating is the process of removing dead skin cells from the surface of your skin using a
                    chemical, granular
                    substance, or exfoliation tool.
                    Your skin naturally sheds dead skin cells to make room for new cells every 30 days or so.
                    Sometimes, dead cells don’t shed completely. This can result in dry, flaky patches and clogged
                    pores.
                    Exfoliating can help prevent this.
                    Unsure where to start?
                    There are a few abrasive materials to choose from for manual exfoliation, including-
                    <li>Cleansing scrubs</li>
                    <li>Exfoliating mitts</li>

                <a href="https://youtu.be/hFDvh_HZauw"> What is semen retention? <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i> </a>
                <p>Semen retention refers to when a person intentionally avoids ejaculating. A person can do this by
                    abstaining
                    from any sexual activity, stopping before the point of ejaculation, or teaching themselves to orgasm
                    without
                    ejaculating.

                    Although this practice may seem new, this is likely only due to recent internet popularity. In fact,
                    semen
                    retention is an ancient practice, believed to boost male physical and spiritual energy.
